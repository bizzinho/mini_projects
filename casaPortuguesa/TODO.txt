CRAWLER

INTERPRETER
- store text files from annuncie for which no information could be extracted
- remaining infos to be read out: Beach Distance, Ria Distance
- store copies into archive folder, not main

SANITY CHECKS
- try to identify potential duplicates

DATA IMPUTATION
- predict year, floor, energy based on other vars
- predict lote of houses based on other vars

REGRESSION
- weird kink in linear method parity plot?
- what to do when residuals has trend over output -> is this measured by R2?
	- check distribution of NaNs vs. price
- investigate biggest outliers

VISUALIZATION
- Houseprice (range) over time
- plot title for getResult

ANALYSIS
- highlight recent houses with very negative spread (and send email??)
	- of particular interest if spread (much) larger than test error
